/*
 * Write an abstract class MarketProduct which has the following private field: â€¢ A String name
 * The class must also have the following public methods:
 * A constructor that takes a String as input indicating the name of product and uses it to initialize the corresponding attribute.
 * A final getName() method to retrieve the name of this MarketProduct.
 * An abstract method getCost() which takes no input and returns an int. 
 *     This method should be abstract (thus, not implemented) because how to determine the cost depends on the type of product.
 * An abstract method equals() which takes an Object as an input and returns a boolean. 
 *     This method should be abstract as well, since depending on the type of product different conditions should be met in order for two products to be considered equal.
